Well, I&#8217;ve configured my new server, and now I can *finally* use my Google Chrome plugin for uTorrent WebUI. Finally I can send all my magnet links to my server. I&#8217;ve even written folder actions in Automator so that when a download is completed, if it is a movie, any movie file with the title &#8220;sample&#8221; is deleted to remove all samples, followed by all the video files being moved to a misc videos folder. This folder then has a folder action to move any video greater than 2GB in size to the movies directory.

Plex Media server scans these folders, and can be instantly watched on the Apple TV or any other computer in the house. Great success I&#8217;d say.

I&#8217;m considering writing a Chrome plugin for me to be able to blog easier, from anywhere on the web as I&#8217;m really getting into blogging.. Maybe next weekend&#8230;.
