Windows 8.1 has been released, however, at the moment it&#8217;s only available via the Microsoft Store. This means downloading the entire 3GB upgrade on EACH computer you wish to upgrade to 8.1.

Seeing as Windows 8.1 or Blue, is ideally classified as a service pack, as it is free, why wouldn&#8217;t they create a standalone MSI? I work in a small computer shop with a connection of 10mbit/s on ADSL as it&#8217;s all we can get in our area, and to update 2 computers at once steals all the bandwidth for other tasks, and takes over 4 hours to download and complete.

Could Microsoft be channelling every new service pack into the Microsoft Store? Could this mean they may charge for future updates? Who knows. All I know is that the person who decided to not release a standalone MSI or installer for 8.1 upgrade deserves a good slap.
