  It&#8217;s been over 3 years since Microsoft last updated their Remote Desktop Connection client for mac. Their client was included in the Microsoft Office 2011 suite, however was available for a standalone download on their website. It worked. Not well. But it worked. It did the job, however only supported a single monitor, and wouldn&#8217;t let you quickly restore saved preferences.

  Finally, Microsoft have released the updated Microsoft Remote Desktop for both Mac and iOS. It&#8217;s available from the App Store. The Mac Client is fantastic. It supports all the features of the Windows client, and even has full support for more than 1 display. This means I can now utilise my 4 screens in full screen on a remote terminal session. Awesome! It has a built in saved session list, supports folder redirection and printer forwarding.<!--more-->

    The same can&#8217;t be said for the iOS client. It connect and works fine, but it&#8217;s impossible to use. It has the same saved connection list as the Mac OS client features.

    Let&#8217;s move on. When opening a connection to a machine you are presented with the following connection screen. Who&#8217;s decision was it to use a nice big red button with a gradient and glass effect? Aren&#8217;t we building for iOS7 now? Eugh!

  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Once you&#8217;re connected things get better &#8211; if you want to just look at the screen and not control it, that is. You&#8217;ve got two options for control. Either fully zoomed in, where you move the screen around using your finger when it is placed on the &#8220;nib&#8221;. You place your finger on the nib, and initiate a scroll, however once your finger reaches the edge of the screen, you&#8217;ve got to go back and put your finger on the tiny nib again. That&#8217;s pointless. Plus you can&#8217;t even see the whole context of the screen. This is useless. Microsoft, implement a full screen scrolling feature or some sort of zoom in/out.

      Your second option for navigation is full screen mode. Slightly more usable than the previous. But good luck touching the tiny red crosses to close apps with your giant sausages you call fingers. You&#8217;ll feel completely clumsy when using this mode. You might need some glasses too.

      <p style="text-align: left;">
        So that&#8217;s the iOS client (tested on iPhone 5), i&#8217;m sure the experience would be slightly improved on a larger screen such as an iPad.
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        Anyway, I&#8217;m glad with the improvements to the OSX client, and I do hope this is the start of more great things to come from Microsoft. However, the iOS client needs more time in the oven I say.
