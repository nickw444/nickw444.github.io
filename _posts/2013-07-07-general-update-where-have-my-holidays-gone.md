It&#8217;s Sunday and half my holidays are already gone! Noo <img src="http://nickwhyte.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> I&#8217;ve barely done any schools work, I&#8217;ve mainly been at work most of the week anyways. I&#8217;ve still got to complete a tonne of work for my software assignment.

This morning I played with extending [JASidePanel][1] creating an easy way to add items to a left panel for a navigation system, and executing code blocks when one is selected. I&#8217;ll be releasing the code whenever I have some free time.

I&#8217;ve been meaning to upload and properly release NWManagedContext/ManagedObject  for a while now, I&#8217;ve had no time though. I&#8217;m going to drop the REST implementation and simply keep it as an object management library with a DB. I&#8217;m currently using my DBMS on my avocado hosting website on [nickwhyte.com&#8230;][2].

As for my avocado, I&#8217;ve now planted it and it&#8217;s living in a pot! Here&#8217;s the new pot, followed by the time lapse video of its growth:



Other things I&#8217;ve been up to this week include: Acquiring a mechanical keyboard &#8211; Just a pretty standard cherry mx 3800, it does the job, and i&#8217;ve used BetterTouchTool on my Hackintosh to map some F keys to media keys (iTunes).

I&#8217;ve also managed to acquire a basic ViewSonic DLP projector for only $90AUD. It&#8217;s pretty basic, and only goes to 800x600px, however it gets the job done &#8211; really well. Having a 3 metre TV in my bedroom is something to boast about.

That&#8217;s about it for now, I&#8217;ll be sure to try blog some more, however, this could change if I get busier&#8230;
