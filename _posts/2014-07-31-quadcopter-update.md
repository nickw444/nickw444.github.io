It&#8217;s been a while since my last quadcopter post &#8211; mainly because i&#8217;ve been in the UK and didn&#8217;t take it with me.

The day that I left for the UK, the new frame that I ordered for the quad arrived.  Every time I upgrade to a new frame, the quad seems to shrink in size.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1477" src="http://nickwhyte.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2014-07-31-14.06.49.jpg" alt="2014-07-31 14.06.49" width="351" height="263" />

This new frame has quite a small wingspan, resulting in a downsize in propellors to a smaller 5&#8243; diameter. It does however have a much lower weight footprint. Weighing in at only 58g, it&#8217;s 20g lighter than the old frame and has much more room for cable management and a nice place underneath (which I&#8217;ve modified) to hold the battery safely during flight.

Overall, I&#8217;m pretty happy with the new frame, however do hope it will be wide enough to still be able to freely manoeuvre the quad.
