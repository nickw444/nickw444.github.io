Been a big day today. Well, the whole last week has been I guess. I think i&#8217;ll do a full summary of my week in this post.

Basically, this week was a critical week for me. Last friday, finding out I had been elected as a prefect of my school. Before I continue, i&#8217;m absolutely grateful that i&#8217;ve reached this far, and consider myself lucky as some of my friends who I believed should have also been elected didn&#8217;t cross the line.

<!--more-->Anyways, all week, I&#8217;ve been preparing my speech for presentation to the teachers in order to run for school captain. Now, my speech was (in my mind), quite well prepared, I&#8217;d spent my whole week preparing to be honest, and absolutely didn&#8217;t want anyone hearing it before I presented it. So, I presented it yesterday (thursday) to the teachers. In my mind, I do believe that it went pretty well, as did my fellow peers (who had also made it this far). My speech had a pretty funny joke at the beginning, and a nice little pun near the end &#8211; &#8220;We need a captain to steer the ship when the seas get rough&#8221;

So today (friday) we had to present to the students in our year group. Now, I know i&#8217;m not the worlds most popular guy between all the people in my year, but I did believe I stood a chance against the other guys presenting. I did present my speech quite well, but it seemed quite dry, the same jokes didn&#8217;t work. Tough crowd.

Anyways, we did have to vote for people in order for the final result. The whole voting process is held online using surveymonkey. Quite a nice website indeed, easy to use and set up. BUT, in my opinion, this particular poll lacked one thing in particular &#8211; stopping students from making multiple votes. Yes, most of my year are honest and wouldn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m sure there may have been people who could have voted twice or more. Nothing was stopping them, all they had to do was write down the survey&#8217;s online URL and type it in on their phone, and away they go. But yeah, that&#8217;s my opinion.

Results are in by lunchtime, the principal is nagged to reveal the final results. From my point of view, I believe that the principal should have maybe taken the weekend to have a look at the trending data, to see what the voting distribution was between the teachers and students. Maybe this may have affected the finaly outcome. Anyways, this was a 100% democratic vote. All votes counted at 1 vote (so i&#8217;ve been informed). Now, this system is good, but, it really turns some stuff into a bit of a popularity contest.

So, we&#8217;re all brought in at lunch by everyone in the prefect body (yes, we&#8217;re capable of organising ourselves). We&#8217;re all sitting patiently, waiting for the results. The results are revealed. Me personally, I&#8217;m absolutely 100% happy with the results of the girls vote results. I believe each and every person deserve the position they were placed in, and as for the ones who missed out, well, it&#8217;s unfortunate, but I guess only three people get these ultimate positions. The boys results are next read out. Reading up from the 3rd position, they get announced. So, this is where I got a tiny bit confused. Now, I&#8217;m really happy for all the guys that did get the position as everyone in the group honestly deserves the position, but, I was a bit bummed that I wasn&#8217;t in the top three positions.

Anyways, the world doesn&#8217;t stop spinning, just as I won&#8217;t stop doing what I do best &#8211; helping. I&#8217;m still a prefect for the school, and I&#8217;m 100% happy and grateful for that. It&#8217;s a wonderful achievement for me and definitely beats any role I managed to gain in my final year of year 6 (oh back in the day&#8230; popularity contests).

The chosen few may do some things differently to how I would have done them, they may get offered with more opportunities, and so on, but really, at the end of the day, I&#8217;ll always know, that to have come this far, it&#8217;s a great thing, and i&#8217;m happy with where I am and what I&#8217;m doing for me, and my school as a whole.
