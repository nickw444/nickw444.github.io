The other day my VESA wall mount arrived in the mail. It&#8217;s a simple $16AUD wall mount, able to hold about 10KG. I drilled the holes in my wall, and hung up my 4th monitor &#8211; another acer, except it&#8217;s only 20&#8243; (V203H).

I managed to get all four monitors to run from my GTX660TI inside OSX (finally) by installing a nvidia driver for CUDA (which I guess comes with a display driver). 2 monitors are running from DVI, One from HDMI to DVI and another using DisplayPort to DVI.
