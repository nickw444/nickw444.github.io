Well, I haven&#8217;t blogged properly all week, so i&#8217;m going to chuck some photos onto this post from last weekend and also from today (Fathers Day). Last weekend I got some more sunrise shots down at Cronulla and today some general bush shots over at the Royal National Park in Wattamolla.

I&#8217;m going to try post some of my old shots throughout the week, but I&#8217;ve really got to begin studying for my yearly exams (woo). It really helps that I don&#8217;t need to do a yearly exam for two extra subjects (as i&#8217;m completing the HSC for them this year instead). I&#8217;ve got a lot more free time for <del>study</del> programming.

So, here&#8217;s the gallery of the shots from last week/today
