So I just caved into starting a 3 month free trial of Spotify. What have I got to lose? It&#8217;s going to make syncing to my android device much easier, plus I can listen to any song I want wherever I am (provided Optus is decent).

<img class="alignleft wp-image-1401" src="http://cdn.nickwhyte.com/static/2014/06/Screenshot-2014-06-15-04.12.21.png" alt="Lots of Playlists" width="133" height="400" />Upon starting my Spotify experience, I needed to import my iTunes playlists. I needed to get all of my playlists out of iTunes. I have a LOT of playlists (Over 300). See the image to the left for example. That&#8217;s only just a minority of them (I&#8217;ve included the scroll bar for reference). Now, getting these outside of iTunes is a process on it&#8217;s own, and getting them into Spotify is even more difficult. This would be somewhat easier I suppose if Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;iTunes Import&#8221; feature wasn&#8217;t greyed out, however there clearly is a problem here:

<div id="attachment_1402" style="width: 301px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

</div>

So the next best thing was to use the iTunes playlist export functionality. This can be done by right clicking a playlist and choosing &#8220;Export&#8221;. Tedious &#8211; yes. I only exported about 15 playlists before researching the next step &#8211; converting these playlists to a format Spotify can handle. Fortunately there are online tools to do this &#8211; however they&#8217;re slow, and can only do one playlist at a time. So this was clearly not an option.

I ended up settling for dragging and dropping playlists into Spotify. The flow was as follows:

  1. Create a new Spotify Playlist
  2. Drag Songs From iTunes into Spotify.
  3. Ensure you didn&#8217;t duplicate anything

Tedious, especially for 300 playlists. I&#8217;m not even sure if I can be bothered to export my entire library to a service I may not use forever. Anyway, we will see where I go with Spotify, and maybe I&#8217;ll end up building the tool that I previously wrote about [here][1].
