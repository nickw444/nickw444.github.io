My first official iPhone App approved on the App Store. It&#8217;s called Listy and is a robust all rounder list application. You can create lists of all sorts, whether it be a Todo list, or a list for the groceries. All the lists are sharable through tweet, text message, or via the clipboard. Simply copy and paste the link around, and you can view them in the web browser or open them in-app.

Yesterday, once my app was approved and on the store, I pulled together a light web interface to view and modify the lists over the web. I also made a little portfolio site for it.

Â At the moment the app is being sold for free. I don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ll ever charge for it, although I may bring advertisements, and create a paid version or in app purchase to remove ads. If you want to get your hands on a copy,[ head over here][2][
