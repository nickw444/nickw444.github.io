I came about this idea just now &#8211; I kind of need to push my blogging a bit more, and actually write some nice articles, guides, and other informative pieces. I&#8217;m going to push myself to write one of these posts weekly, just to round up my week and the things I&#8217;ve come across. It&#8217;ll be a great way for me to track what i&#8217;ve been up to, and allow me to come back and see when I did things of importance to me.

I began my week with pushing out ANOTHER release of Listy for iOS. I screwed up the previous release in my analytics framework ([askingpoint][1] &#8211; which you should check out). I ended up releasing and pushing to the app store under the API key of the development build &#8211; causing all my stats for the app end up under the wrong section in my account. I quickly pushed the new update and all was good.

[Reaver-wps][2] was something the caught my attention this week &#8211; It turns out the WPS (Wifi protected setup) has some massive vulnerabilities, which is pretty cool, and I think i&#8217;ll be loading up BT linux on my laptop to see it in action with my own WPS router. I&#8217;ll be sure to post results of this later tonight &#8211; and possibly a how to.

After my new release of Listy for iOS was approved and put up for download in the app store, I began wondering what SEO techniques could be used to push me up a little further. I had set up a Facebook advertising campaign, got about 30 installs over 2 days, however that cost me $30 AUD&#8230; Probably wasn&#8217;t worth doing &#8211; Facebook ads are VERY expensive &#8211; even on a CPM (Cost per million) mode. So I began searching for other  methods to push my app higher. I found[ this awesome post ][3] outlining tonnes of useful resources. I then began wondering about SEO in the app store. I then began to wonder what my key words were set to &#8211; yep, the keywords I set when I released version 1.0 (ew :/). So I began brainstorming some new key words, however, I&#8217;m unable to change them until I next push an update (stupid itunes connect).

I began looking at some neat frameworks for doing network requests within iOS for my Major Project &#8211; I found the [AFNetworking framework][4] &#8211; It has completion blocks for asynchronous loading! No more stupid delegate work for requesting data from the web. I also began researching RESTful API&#8217;s and how to implement and use one &#8211; However, there isn&#8217;t really anything nice for PHP &#8211; So, i&#8217;m still stuck for what I should use &#8211; whether I should use ruby on rails&#8230;

[This article about CSS ][5]and it&#8217;s architecture and how to use CSS properly really amazed me- The way CSS should be done. It has fantastic examples about how making CSS hacks kind of sucks.

Later in the week I stumbled upon the facebook developers live conference. I watched the &#8220;[How we Built Facebook for iOS][6]&#8220;, which is honestly the most informative 45 minute video about organisation, and working in massive teams to develop a single application. The video outlines great tools to use in your development workflow.
