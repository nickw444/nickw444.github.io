Last year I predicted the top 3 results in order in Triple J's hottest 100. This year I'm back at it again, however, <a href="http://nickwhyte.com/100-warm-tunas-2016/">now with a webpage and a Spotify playlist</a>.

Results are collected, optimised, and processed multiple times per day. Instagram images tagged with #hottest100 and a few others are included for counting.

Happy voting!
