#### Changelog:

  * Added App Icon (Green iTunes yeah close enough)
  * You can now select a playlist by clicking the entire row, not just the checkbox
  * PlaylistGrabber now remembers what playlists you selected last time
  * You can save your progress of playlist selection by pressing &#8220;Save Selected&#8221;
  * PlaylistGrabber now remembers what XML File you last used. Quick and Easy Startup.
  * PlaylistGrabber skips copying files that already exist in the destination (good if you&#8217;re using a cloud service). It will however re-generate M3U Files so you will get playlist updates.
  * Tableview now has pretty icons
  * Tableview nests items inside folders at their level as depicted within itunes. Wish i could indent the icon too.
  * &#8220;About&#8221; window updated.
  * Auto build incrementing (current release is build 110)
  * Automatically quits app on window close.

#### Things I&#8217;d Like it to do better

  * Nest icons for folder indentation levels
  * Delete songs when a playlist is de-selected. This could prove quite tricky

I&#8217;m pretty happy with what I have achieved over the few hours I&#8217;ve worked on this project. And after all, I&#8217;ve learnt how to program for Mac OSX.

#### Help Me Out

I am currently a student, studying Computer Science at the University of New South Wales, Australia. If you like this app, please consider donating &#8211; The more donations, the more incentive for me to bring new features.
