Not sure if turning into cliché hipster with MacBook in a Café on Facebook pretending to be a &#8216;start up&#8217;. Maybe one day, I will have and idea and actually spend most of my time in a café programming it. Anyways, that&#8217;s not now, for now we have photos (Well only one, my phone&#8217;s internet is too slow :/ ).
