It&#8217;s almost done! Here&#8217;s some pre-release screenshots of the app (V1.0 build 1552). There&#8217;s still some work to do, as well as a tonne of theory. Luckily i&#8217;ve been keeping a giant logbook of all the work I&#8217;ve done on the project through the assistance of git, which is going to help me out when I need to write up my project logbook in a formal matter.
