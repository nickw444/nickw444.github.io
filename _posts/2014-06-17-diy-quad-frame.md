I just ordered a cheap $30 56g lightweight frame off ebay, however, I need something in the mean time to get set up with. Instead of using the ugly and heavy (~250g) wooden frame, I have built this frame from some spare materials I found in the garage.

Next up, I will need to make all the electronic connections and determine where to house the RPi and battery on the quad. I am going to have to now be careful about positioning of the electronics as the entire frame is conductive :S

Here are a couple of picture of the new frame&#8217;s construction
