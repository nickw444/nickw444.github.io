Within Australia, low cost, high bandwidth internet is something we need in the future, however, the future is looking dull. The Liberal Government of Australia have now proposed a new plan to roll out a nation wide internet network for a fraction of the cost of the implementation of the NBN by the Labor Party, however, the amendments are not for the better. They are a waste.

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1193" alt="BTj8DJLCQAA2iA9" src="http://cdn.nickwhyte.com/static/2013/09/BTj8DJLCQAA2iA9-300x169.jpg" width="300" height="169" />][1]Tony Abbot&#8217;s NBN will consist of a Fibre to the Node Network (FTTN), which involves running fibre connections to ugly above ground nodes to provide for 20-30 households each. Each household will be connected to the node through existing copper connections. Within a node, switching hardware will be required, as well as modulation and demodulation hardware. Households will be using a VDSL protocol, theoretically capable of speeds up to 250mbit/s. This is fast, but will it be fast enough in 7 years when the rollout will be complete (2019)? The government only promise speeds of 25-100mbit/s by 2016 and 50-100mbit/s by 2019). The predicted cost of Liberal&#8217;s network is $30 Billion.

Labor&#8217;s NBN would have consisted of a Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) Network, which involves running fibre from Households directly to telecom exchanges. No existing copper infrastructure would be in use, and anyone on existing copper would be moved onto the NBN network for both Telephone and Internet. A fibre connection is capable of over 26Tbit/s (27262976mbit/s &#8211; more than 100000x faster than VDSL &#8211; Record set by [NEC][2]Â over a 50 km distance) &#8211; A connection medium more than perfect for many years to come; future-proof. Labor promised speeds of up to 1000mbit/s to be available to consumers by the end of 2013. The predicted cost of Labor&#8217;s network was $44.1 billion, $14 billion more than Liberal&#8217;s FTTN network, however, I believe, in the long run, would have been the most cost effective solution.

These costs could eventually add up to the $30 billion the plan would be saving, and overall leave us with a slow, out of date, high maintenance and high cost network, and thus shows how a FTTN network is completely pointless.

Instead of running a whole new network, many households in built up areas already have access to Telstra and Optus cable, which is easily capable of 100mbit/s connections. Why is the Government building a network that we already have. It is outrageous to think that we are building an infrastructure that is going to be out of date within 5 years, and ALREADY exists. Why bother waiting for NBN in your area now? Just jump on an Optus or Telstra cable plan and enjoy the NBN speeds that you&#8217;ll be stuck with until the government realises they need to roll out Fibre in 10 years time to keep up with the growing demands of internet and technology.
