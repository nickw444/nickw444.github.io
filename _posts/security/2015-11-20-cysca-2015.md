I've recently published all my writeups for CySCA 2015's Web Pentest component 
as well as Corporate Pentest, however, Corporate Pentest is incomplete.

#### Corporate Pentest
Some writeups based on my experience during the competition. This was the first
time I had ever experimented with corporate pentest style problems, hence why 
I did not get very far. I do, however, wish to share my experience.

#### Web Applications Pentest

Whilst writing these writeups, I actually stepped through them using the CySCA
2015 challenges, rather than guessing them from the notes I had taken during the
competition. 

CySCA have yet to release a "CySCA In A Box" yet, so I thought, rather than just
making the challenge work _just_ for me, I thought it would be beneficial to 
create a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) environment so that anyone can 
get the challenges up and running in no time at all. 

Head on over to [this repo/page](https://github.com/nickw444/CySCA2015/tree/master/web_application_pentest/files) on my github for instructions on getting set up.
