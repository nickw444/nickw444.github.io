One more post before bed&#8230;

I once again had a crack at geektool, except this time, I&#8217;ve integrated an image. Based on my LockWeather JavaScript winterboard theme for iOS, I&#8217;ve pulled the same sort of data from Yahoo Weather and integrated it into php scripts to make this awesome weather forecast widget on my desktop. I&#8217;m happy with it.
