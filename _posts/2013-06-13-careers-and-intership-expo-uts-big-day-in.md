Today I attended a conference at UTS regarding university and getting a job. Many different companies talked, however I didn&#8217;t feel any of the talks were engaging enough &#8211; with google as an exception

The google talk lasted about an hour, where the employees of the company talked about the work life and the possible ways to achieve a job. We were told all about how awesome working in the software engineering and consulting field is, and the many opportunities of pathways into big companies like google &#8211; such as internships. Funnily enough, they made a joke about the movie &#8220;the internship. 

Overall today, I got the impression that employers are very desperate for new, young workers, as they made many implications that if you work for them; you&#8217;ll have a great quality of life &#8211; such as free food, plenty of breaks, free time, etc. 

I&#8217;m really looking forward to finishing school, and completing university.
