It's been a while since I last wrote a blog post, I've been busy working, writing code, and doing general work for university.

I've been scheduled to do a talk for UNSW's CSESoc about git, which has given me great motivation to go and find cool and awesome things to do with git. I found Lolcommits! See the left hand menu of this page (on desktop only), you can see my latest commit message (and a funny photo, hopefully) for projects I have enabled lolcommits on. 

My idea stemmed from me joking about how it would be funny if it automatically uploaded the image to my blog, but slowly evolved into actually becoming a thing.

All that's left now to do is for the latest image to be automatically uploaded after it is created!
