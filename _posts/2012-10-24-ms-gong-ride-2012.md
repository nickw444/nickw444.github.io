This year, I'll be participating in the MS Foundation's Sydney to Wollongong Ride.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system which affects more young adult Australians than any other neurological condition. It is a life long disease for which a cure is yet to be found. MS Australia aims to minimize the impact of multiple sclerosis on all individuals affected by the disease, as well as their families, careers and the community, by offering a wide range of services, equipment and support

I will be riding as a member of my school's team - Gymea Technology High School, riding from St Peters to  Wollongong.

Thanks
