### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick, A frontend engineer at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). I love complex problems and challenges, and things that give me something new and interesting to work on.

As might be apparent from my numerous home automation repositories, in my free time I enjoy dabbling in [home automation](https://github.com/nickw444/home). I'm a huge evangelist of [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and run it at a few different physical sites.

On the side I run [100 Warm Tunas](https://100warmtunas.com), an social aggregation site, intended to predict triple j's Hottest 100 each year.
