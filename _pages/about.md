### Hey there!

I'm Nick, student of UNSW, studying Computer Science. I build web-apps, websites, iPhone/iPad apps, and many more custom solutions.

Languages (Strongest):
 - Python
 - Python (Flask)
 - JavaScript (ES6, React.JS)
 - JavaScript, JavaScript (jQuery), HTML, CSS, CSS (LESS)
 - Objective C / Foundation/Cocoa

 - PHP

Languages (Strong to Moderate):
