### My works

I used to spend a tonne of time creating and working on projects from my heart’s desire, however over the past 2 years, life has unfortunately come in the way.

Nowadays, I am working on [private projects at work for clients](http://twopicode.com), and working much less on my own projects.

I do still however have available a minority of my projects, which was once a gigantic list. Maybe one day more will be here.

## iOS Projects

*   [qBuzz for iOS](https://qbuzz.com.au/)
*   [Listy for iOS](http://listy.nickwhyte.com)
*   [L Plater for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/id458958123?mt=8)

## Cocoa OSX Projects

## Other Projects (From a long time ago)
